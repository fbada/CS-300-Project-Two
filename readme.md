# üéì Course Planner

## Overview
The **Course Planner** application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to assist academic advisors in managing and viewing course data for a Computer Science program. It allows users to:
- üìÇ Load course data from a CSV file.
- üìë Display an alphanumerically ordered list of all courses.
- üîç Print detailed information about specific courses, including their prerequisites.

## Features
- **Load Course Data**: Easily load course information from a CSV file.
- **View All Courses**: Display a neatly formatted, alphanumerically ordered list of all courses.
- **Course Details**: Retrieve and display detailed information about individual courses and their prerequisites.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a visually appealing, color-coded command-line interface.

## Prerequisites
- **C++14 or later**
- **A C++ compiler** (e.g., g++)

## How to Use

### üì• Load Data Structure
1. Enter `1` to load course data from a CSV file.
2. Provide the filename when prompted (e.g., `ABCU_Advising_Program_Input.csv`).

### üìú Print Course List
1. Enter `2` to display an alphanumerically ordered list of courses.

### üîé Print Course
1. Enter `3` and provide a course number to see detailed information about the course and its prerequisites.

### üö™ Exit
 Enter `9` to exit the application.
